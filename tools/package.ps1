#                                                            shortcut, coop\coop-installer.ps1 + coop-texts.ps1 for the uninstaller, coop\version.txt)

# Run native\build.sh first. The developer tools (console, test hooks) are inside the DLL but do nothing without their environment variables. The package sets no
# environment variable of its own and the shortcut's launcher sets none (REV2_ACHBLOCK and the other lab switches stay unset).
# Usage: package.ps1 -Version 0.1.0 [-Exe] [-Dist <folder>] [-Dll <dinput8.dll>]
# -Dll: the DLL to ship (default native\build\dinput8.dll; `OUT=build-x/dinput8.dll sh native/build.sh` builds one elsewhere).
# -Exe also builds dist\revelations2-coop-setup-<version>.exe: a single-file installer that carries this zip (an ADDITIONAL release asset; the zip stays the one the
# shortcut's launcher updates from: the launcher takes the first asset matching revelations2-coop-*.zip). Made by <workspace>\tools\mkinstaller (-Mkinstaller <folder>
# for a clone placed elsewhere); the exe is unsigned. -Dist: write to that folder instead of dist\ (tests).
