# Usage: package.ps1 -Version 0.1.0 [-Exe] [-Dist <folder>] [-Dll <dinput8.dll>] [-LogCollector <folder>] [-AnyDllVersion]
# -Dll: the DLL to ship (default native\build\dinput8.dll; `OUT=build-x/dinput8.dll sh native/build.sh` builds one elsewhere). Its R2_VERSION (native\r2.h, a string
# of its own in the DLL) must be -Version: coop\version.txt is what the launcher compares, the DLL's version is what the log says. -AnyDllVersion: skip that (tests,
# dry runs of a coming version).
# -LogCollector: the log collector's folder for a clone placed elsewhere (default <workspace>\tools\log-collector: the first tools\log-collector above the repository,
# three levels above mod\, four above a worktree in work\).
# -Exe also builds dist\revelations2-coop-setup-<version>.exe: a single-file installer that carries this zip (an ADDITIONAL release asset; the zip stays the one the
# shortcut's launcher updates from: the launcher takes the first asset matching revelations2-coop-*.zip). Made by <workspace>\tools\mkinstaller (-Mkinstaller <folder>
# for a clone placed elsewhere); the exe is unsigned. -Dist: write to that folder instead of dist\ (tests).
