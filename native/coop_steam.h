/*
 * Steam backend of the co-op transport ("steam" in coop_net.h): a Steam lobby for rendezvous / invites / "Join game", and the
 * lobby members talk to each other through Steam's relay network. No IP address, no port forwarding.
 *
 * Layers (all in coop_steam.c):
 *   cst_plat   a small platform interface in plain C types (64-bit ids, strings, bytes). The real one drives the Steam
 *              interfaces the GAME ITSELF holds (steam_api.dll of the game, no second Steam API); the tests plug a mock universe
 *              in through cst_set_platform. Nothing else in the file knows a vtable.
 *   backend    cn_ops "steam": lobby with our own private tag, link handshake, data/ping/bye messages, disconnect detection.
 *   commands   `net steamhost | steamjoin | steamlobbies | steaminvite | steam ...` (cst_command, called by cs_command).
 *   hooks      called by steam.c in the proxy: the game's SteamInternal_ContextInit result, a tick on the game thread before
 *              SteamAPI_RunCallbacks, and a filter for the game's own callbacks (cst_swallow_game_callback).
 *
 * Design, traps and the proof that the game never sees our packets: docs/steam-transport.md, notes in the lab (stage4-steam).
